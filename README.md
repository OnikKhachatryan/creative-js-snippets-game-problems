This repository contains various JavaScript and DOM practice exercises created while learning front-end development. Each file demonstrates a different concept like element creation, styling, event handling, and animations.

# Frontend DOM Projects

This repository contains a collection of small front-end projects built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Each project focuses on practicing core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, 
event handling, dynamic element creation, and simple animations.

## What's Included

- Dynamic `<div>` generators
- Random color styling
- Element movement with JavaScript
- Display toggling and conditional rendering
- Auto-generated shapes using `setInterval`
- Positioning elements using absolute/relative layouts
- Simulated animations and interaction effects

## Purpose

These projects were created to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, improve my ability to manipulate the DOM programmatically, and practice UI design fundamentals. 
This collection showcases my growth as a Junior Front-End Developer and my interest in building creative, interactive web elements.
